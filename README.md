# Covid-Operations-Central-System

---DATABASE---  
The application needs a mysql or compatible database and a user with privileges to create, alter and drop tables and to insert, select, update and delete rows.
The database and user must be setup as:  
HOST: localhost  
PORT: 3306  
NAME: cocsdb  
USER: cocsadmin  
PASS: 12345678  
  
If no admins exist in the database, a default Admin account will be created during start-up with default credentials:  
USER: Admin  
PASS: 0000
